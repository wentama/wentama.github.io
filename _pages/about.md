I am a recent graduate with a BS in [Data Science and Analytics](https://engineering.case.edu/computer-and-data-sciences) from [Case Western Reserve University](https://case.edu/) (CWRU). Currently, I work as a Data Science and Remote Sensing Intern at [CTrees](https://ctrees.org/about), focusing on global carbon tracking by applying various machine learning techniques, such as change detection algorithm and convolutional neural network, on satellite data.

Previously, I interned at NASAâ€™s Jet Propulsion Laboratory [(JPL)](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/) with the [UAVSAR](https://uavsar.jpl.nasa.gov/) Mission team, where I applied classification algorithms to wildfire monitoring using synthetic aperture radar data from remote sensing. During my time at CWRU, I collaborated with Professor [Sakshi Arya](https://sakshiarya.github.io) on research into decision-making problems in agricultural science using multi-armed bandit algorithms. Additionally, I contributed to the Database Group under Professor [Yinghui Wu](https://yinghwu.github.io/index.html), where I assisted with graphical user interface design and data management for materials research.

__Skills & Tools__: Python, R, SQL, Javascript, Unix, AWS EC2, AWS S3, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Data Science, QGIS, Google Earth Engine, Ray Framework, Anyscale, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Remote Sensing, Geospatial Analysis, Machine Learning, Multi-Armed Bandit Algorithms, GUI design.
