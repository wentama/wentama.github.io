This project is the senior capstone completed to fulfill the rqeuirement for bachelor's in data science and analytics from CWRU. 

Timbre works with existing music services to fill a gap by providing a solution for music social media. Most music streaming services recommend music primarily based on the music that someone has listened to, but Timbre differs by providing recommendations based on the music that other people with similar preferences recommend, which combines both a data science approach with a social media aspect.

The front-end and middleware is built using Next.js, a React based full-stack framework, and the backend database is hosted on PostgreSQL, a relational database management system. Our group consists of 5 members and I primarily worked on the backend and middleware to
- design and implement the database
- develop and optimize compatibility score calculation
- formulate user-matching procedure and algorithm 
- integrate SQL and javascript functions to process frontend requests

## Site Breakdown
The site can be broken down into four pages: home, matches, friends, and profile.

### Homepage

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/timbre/homepage_track.png" title="homepage image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/timbre/homepage_search.png" title="searchbar image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Homepage screen. Left: homepage with the search bar and top tracks of the user. Right: song view that allows one to play and rate the song upon clicking the track in the search bar or in the top tracks page.
</div>

This page provides the user's listening data and allows them to search and rate songs to help us improve their matches.

### Matches

### Friends

### Profile

<div class="caption">
    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.
</div>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
